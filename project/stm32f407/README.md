​          sgp30 is a basic command which can test all sgp30 driver function:

​           -i        show sgp30 chip and driver information.

​           -h       show sgp30 help.

​           -p       show sgp30 pin connections of the current board.

​           -t (reg | read <times>)           

​           -t reg        run sgp30 register test.

​           -t read <times>        run spg30 read test. times means test times.

​           -c (read <times> | advance (-read <times>|-read <times> (-baseline <tvoc> <co2eq>|-humidity <temperature> <rh>)) | -info (id | product)))

​           -c read <times>        run spg30 read function. times means read times.

​           -c advance -read <times>        run spg30 advance read function. times means read times.

​           -c advance -read <times> -baseline <tvoc> <co2eq>        run spg30 advance read function with baseline. times means read times. tvoc means current tvoc. co2eq means current co2eq.

​           -c advance -read <times> -humidity <temperature> <rh>        run spg30 advance read function with humidity. times means read times. temperature means current temperature.rh means current relative humidity.

​           -c -info id        get spg30 id information.

​           -c -info product        get spg30 product information.
